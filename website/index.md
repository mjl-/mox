quickstart, add the printed DNS records, and you've got a working modern mail
server. See the demo below, or continue reading at [Install](install/).

Not ready for a full setup yet? Try mox in less than a minute:
[download](https://beta.gobuilds.org/github.com/mjl-/mox) and run "mox
localserve". It serves a local-only SMTP/IMAP/Webmail/etc for testing and
development. No setup required.

## Background

Work on mox started in 2021. Admins were migrating their emails to just a few
cloud/hosting providers. In part because running and maintaining email software
had become more complicated over time: additional email protocols required yet
another component in the software stack. Combining all these components into a
working email server had become too troublesome over time. These components
were also often written in C, a programming language where a small mistake
typically has large consequences.

Mox is a modern email server that implements all modern email protocols in a
single easy to use and maintain application.


## Sponsors

Mox development is sponsored from August 2023 to August 2024 through NLnet/EU's
NGI0 Entrust, see https://nlnet.nl/project/Mox/.
