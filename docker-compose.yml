# Before launching mox, run the quickstart to create config files for running as
# user the mox user (create it on the host system first, e.g. "useradd -d $PWD mox"):

#
# note: if you are running quickstart on a different machine than you will deploy
# mox to, use the "quickstart -hostname ..." flag.
