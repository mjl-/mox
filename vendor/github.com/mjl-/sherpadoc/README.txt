# todo

- major cleanup required. too much parsing is done that can probably be handled by the go/* packages.
- check that all cases of embedding work (seems like we will include duplicates: when a struct has fields that override an embedded struct, we generate duplicate fields).
- check that all cross-package referencing (ast.SelectorExpr) works
- better cli syntax for replacements and renames, and always replace based on fully qualified names. currently you need to specify both the fully qualified and unqualified type paths.
- see if order of items in output depends on a map somewhere, i've seen diffs for generated jsons where a type was only moved, not modified. perhaps the type was discovered earlier/later because of other type changes. we may want to sort sections,methods,types in the output.
- better error messages and error handling, stricter parsing
- support type aliases
- support plain iota enums? currently only simple literals are supported for enums.
- support complete expressions for enum consts?
- find out which go constructs people want to use that aren't yet implemented by sherpadoc
- when to make a field nullable. when omitempty is set? (currently yes), when field is a pointer type (currently yes). should we have a way to prevent nullable without omitempty set, or make field a pointer without it being nullable?
- write tests
