/*
Package config holds the configuration file definitions.

Mox uses two config files:

1. mox.conf, also called the static configuration file.
2. domains.conf, also called the dynamic configuration file.

The static configuration file is never reloaded during the lifetime of a
running mox instance. After changes to mox.conf, mox must be restarted for the
changes to take effect.

The dynamic configuration file is reloaded automatically when it changes.
If the file contains an error after the change, the reload is aborted and the
previous version remains active.

Below are "empty" config files, generated from the config file definitions in
the source code, along with comments explaining the fields. Fields named "x" are
placeholders for user-chosen map keys.

# sconf

The config files are in "sconf" format. Properties of sconf files:

  - Indentation with tabs only.
  - "#" as first non-whitespace character makes the line a comment. Lines with a
    value cannot also have a comment.
  - Values don't have syntax indicating their type. For example, strings are
    not quoted/escaped and can never span multiple lines.
  - Fields that are optional can be left out completely. But the value of an
    optional field may itself have required fields.

See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mjl-/sconf for details.

# mox.conf

	# NOTE: This config file is in 'sconf' format. Indent with tabs. Comments must be
	# on their own line, they don't end a line. Do not escape or quote strings.

			# with a WebPKI-verified HTTPS request. The policy can indicate that
			# WebPKI-verified SMTP STARTTLS is required, and which MX hosts (optionally with a
			# wildcard pattern) are allowd. MX hosts to deliver to are still taken from DNS
			# (again, not necessarily protected/verified), but messages will only be delivered
			# to domains matching the MX hosts from the published policy. Mail servers look up
			# the MTA-STS policy when first delivering to a domain, then keep a cached copy,
			# periodically checking the DNS record if a new policy is available, and fetching
			# and caching it if so. To update a policy, first serve a new policy with an
			# updated policy ID, then update the DNS record (not the other way around). To
			# remove an enforced policy, publish an updated policy with mode "none" for a long
			# enough period so all cached policies have been refreshed (taking DNS TTL and

# Examples

Mox includes configuration files to illustrate common setups. You can see these
examples with "mox config example", and print a specific example with "mox
config example <name>". Below are all examples included in mox.

# Example webhandlers

	# Snippet of domains.conf to configure WebDomainRedirects and WebHandlers.

	# Redirect all requests for mox.example to https://www.mox.example.
	WebDomainRedirects:
		mox.example: www.mox.example

	# Each request is matched against these handlers until one matches and serves it.
	WebHandlers:
		-
			# Redirect all plain http requests to https, leaving path, query strings, etc
			# intact. When the request is already to https, the destination URL would have the
			# same scheme, host and path, causing this redirect handler to not match the
			# request (and not cause a redirect loop) and the webserver to serve the request
			# with a later handler.
			LogName: redirhttps
			Domain: www.mox.example
			PathRegexp: ^/
			# Could leave DontRedirectPlainHTTP at false if it wasn't for this being an
			# example for doing this redirect.
			DontRedirectPlainHTTP: true
			WebRedirect:
				BaseURL: https://www.mox.example
		-
			# The name of the handler, used in logging and metrics.
			LogName: staticmjl
			# With ACME configured, each configured domain will automatically get a TLS
			# certificate on first request.
			Domain: www.mox.example
			PathRegexp: ^/who/mjl/
			WebStatic:
				StripPrefix: /who/mjl
				# Requested path /who/mjl/inferno/ resolves to local web/mjl/inferno.
				# If a directory contains an index.html, it is served when a directory is requested.
				Root: web/mjl
				# With ListFiles true, if a directory does not contain an index.html, the contents are listed.

			DontRedirectPlainHTTP: true
			WebRedirect:
				# Just change the domain and add query string set fragment. No change to scheme.
				# Path will start with /redir/a/b/c (and whathever came after) because no
				# OrigPathRegexp+ReplacePath is set.

# Example transport

	# Snippet for mox.conf, defining a transport called Example that connects on the
	# SMTP submission with TLS port 465 ("submissions"), authenticating with
	# SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS (other providers may not support SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS, but they
	# typically do support the older CRAM-MD5).:

	# Transport are mechanisms for delivering messages. Transports can be referenced
	# from Routes in accounts, domains and the global configuration. There is always
	# an implicit/fallback delivery transport doing direct delivery with SMTP from the
	# outgoing message queue. Transports are typically only configured when using
	# smarthosts, i.e. when delivering through another SMTP server. Zero or one
	# transport methods must be set in a transport, never multiple. When using an
	# external party to send email for a domain, keep in mind you may have to add
	# their IP address to your domain's SPF record, and possibly additional DKIM
	# records. (optional)
	Transports:
		Example:
			# Submission SMTP over a TLS connection to submit email to a remote queue.
			# (optional)
			Submissions:
				# Host name to connect to and for verifying its TLS certificate.
				Host: smtp.example.com

				# If set, authentication credentials for the remote server. (optional)
				Auth:
					Username: user@example.com
					Password: test1234
					Mechanisms:
						# Allowed authentication mechanisms. Defaults to SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS,
						# SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, SCRAM-SHA-1, CRAM-MD5. Not included by default:
						# PLAIN. Specify the strongest mechanism known to be implemented by the server to
						# prevent mechanism downgrade attacks. (optional)

						- SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS


	# Snippet for domains.conf, specifying a route that sends through the transport:

	# Routes for delivering outgoing messages through the queue. Each delivery attempt
	# evaluates account routes, domain routes and finally these global routes. The
	# transport of the first matching route is used in the delivery attempt. If no
	# routes match, which is the default with no configured routes, messages are
	# delivered directly from the queue. (optional)
	Routes:
		-
