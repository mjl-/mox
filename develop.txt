# TLS certificates

https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl is useful for testing with TLS
certificates. Create a CA and configure it in mox.conf TLS.CA.CertFiles, and
sign host certificates and configure them in the listeners TLS.KeyCerts.

Setup a local CA with cfssl, run once:

```sh
go install github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/cfssl@latest
go install github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/cfssljson@latest

mkdir -p local/cfssl
cd local/cfssl

cfssl print-defaults config > ca-config.json # defaults are fine

# Based on: cfssl print-defaults csr > ca-csr.json
cat <<EOF >ca-csr.json
{
    "CN": "mox ca",
    "key": {
        "algo": "ecdsa",
        "size": 256
    },
    "names": [
        {
            "C": "NL"
        }
    ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca - # Generate ca key and cert.

# Generate wildcard certificates for one or more domains, add localhost for use with pebble, see below.
domains="moxtest.example localhost"
for domain in $domains; do
	cat <<EOF >wildcard.$domain.csr.json
{
  "key": {
    "algo": "ecdsa",
    "size": 256
  },
  "names": [
  {
    "O": "mox"
  }
  ],
  "hosts": [
    "$domain",
    "*.$domain"
  ]
}
EOF
	cfssl gencert -ca ca.pem -ca-key ca-key.pem -profile=www wildcard.$domain.csr.json | cfssljson -bare wildcard.$domain
done
```

Now configure mox.conf to add the cfssl CA root certificate:

```
TLS:
	CA:
		AdditionalToSystem: true
		CertFiles:
			# Assuming local/<env>/config/mox.conf and local/cfssl/.
			- ../../cfssl/ca.pem

[...]

Listeners:
	public:
                TLS:
			KeyCerts:
				# Assuming local/<env>/config/mox.conf and local/cfssl/.
				CertFile: ../../cfssl/wildcard.$domain.pem
				KeyFile: ../../cfssl/wildcard.$domain-key.pem
```

# ACME

https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble is useful for testing with ACME. Start a
pebble instance that uses the localhost TLS cert/key created by cfssl for its
TLS serving. Pebble generates a new CA certificate for its own use each time it
is started. Fetch it from https://localhost:15000/roots/0, write it to a file, and
add it to mox.conf TLS.CA.CertFiles. See below.

Setup pebble, run once:

```sh
go install github.com/letsencrypt/pebble/cmd/pebble@latest

mkdir -p local/pebble
cat <<EOF >local/pebble/config.json
{
  "pebble": {
    "listenAddress": "localhost:14000",
    "managementListenAddress": "localhost:15000",
    "certificate": "local/cfssl/localhost.pem",
    "privateKey": "local/cfssl/localhost-key.pem",
    "httpPort": 80,
    "tlsPort": 443,
    "ocspResponderURL": "",
    "externalAccountBindingRequired": false
  }
}
EOF
```

Start pebble, this generates a new temporary pebble CA certificate:

```sh
pebble -config local/pebble/config.json
```

Write new CA bundle that includes pebble's temporary CA cert:

```sh
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=local/ca-bundle.pem # for curl
export SSL_CERT_FILE=local/ca-bundle.pem # for go apps
cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt local/cfssl/ca.pem >local/ca-bundle.pem
curl https://localhost:15000/roots/0 >local/pebble/ca.pem # fetch temp pebble ca, DO THIS EVERY TIME PEBBLE IS RESTARTED!
cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt local/cfssl/ca.pem local/pebble/ca.pem >local/ca-bundle.pem # create new list that includes cfssl ca and temp pebble ca.
rm -r local/*/data/acme/keycerts/pebble # remove existing pebble-signed certs in acme cert/key cache, they are invalid due to newly generated temp pebble ca.
```

Edit mox.conf, adding pebble ACME and its ca.pem:

```
ACME:
	pebble:
		DirectoryURL: https://localhost:14000/dir
		ContactEmail: root@mox.example
TLS:
	CA:
		AdditionalToSystem: true
		CertFiles:
			# Assuming local/<env>/config/mox.conf and local/pebble/ca.pem and local/cfssl/ca.pem.
			- ../../pebble/ca.pem
			- ../../cfssl/ca.pem

[...]

Listeners:
	public:
                TLS:
                        ACME: pebble
```

For mail clients and browsers to accept pebble-signed certificates, you must add
the temporary pebble CA cert to their trusted root CA store each time pebble is
started (e.g. to your thunderbird/firefox testing profile). Pebble has no option
to not regenerate its CA certificate, presumably for fear of people using it for
non-testing purposes. Unfortunately, this also makes it inconvenient to use for
testing purposes.


# Messages for testing

For compatibility and preformance testing, it helps to have many messages,
created a long time ago and recently, by different mail user agents. A helpful
source is the Linux kernel mailing list. Archives are available as multiple git
repositories (split due to size) at
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/_/text/mirror/.  The git repo's can be converted
to compressed mbox files (about 800MB each) with:

```
# 0 is the first epoch (with over half a million messages), 12 is last
# already-complete epoch at the time of writing (with a quarter million
# messages). The archives are large, converting will take some time.
for i in 0 12; do
        git clone --mirror http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/$i lkml-$i.git
        (cd lkml-$i.git && time ./tombox.sh | gzip >../lkml-$i.mbox.gz)
done
```

With the following "tobmox.sh" script:

```
#!/bin/sh
pre=''
for rev in $(git rev-list master | reverse); do
        printf "$pre"
        echo "From sender@host  $(date '+%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y' -d @$(git show -s --format=%ct $rev))"
        git show ${rev}:m | sed 's/^>*From />&/'
        pre='\n'
done
```


# Release proces

- Build and run tests with previous major Go release.
- Run tests, including with race detector.
- Run integration and upgrade tests.
- Run fuzzing tests for a while.
- Deploy to test environment. Test the update instructions.

- Send and receive email with imap4/smtp clients.
- Check DNS check admin page.
- Check with https://internet.nl
- Create git tag, push code.
- Publish new docker image.
- Publish signed release notes for updates.xmox.nl and update DNS record.
- Create new release on the github page, so watchers get a notification.
